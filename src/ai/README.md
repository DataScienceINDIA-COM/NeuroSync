# AI Module

This directory (`src/ai`) contains code related to the application's artificial intelligence features. It includes implementations for various AI flows and tools used to enhance user experience and provide intelligent functionalities.

## Subfolders

- **`flows`**: This subfolder likely contains definitions and implementations of AI flows, which are sequences of operations or prompts designed to achieve specific AI-driven tasks (e.g., generating content, providing recommendations).
- **`tools`**: This subfolder probably houses AI tools, which are individual functions or services that AI models can utilize to perform actions or retrieve information (e.g., calculating points, interacting with external APIs).

## Files

- **`coach.ts`**: Likely contains code related to an AI coaching feature, possibly defining the AI's persona, responses, or interaction logic for providing guidance or support to users.
- **`dev.ts`**: Could contain development-specific AI code, such as testing utilities, debugging tools, or configurations for the AI environment during development.
- **`genkit.ts`**: This file might be related to GenKit, a framework for building AI applications, and could contain configurations or initializations for using GenKit.
- **`hormone-prediction.ts`**: Likely implements AI models or logic for predicting hormone-related patterns or providing insights based on hormone data.
- **`schemas.ts`**: This file probably defines data schemas or interfaces used by the AI models or flows to ensure data consistency and type safety.
