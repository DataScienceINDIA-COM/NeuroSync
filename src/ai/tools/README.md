# src/ai/tools

This directory contains specific utilities or functions that AI flows can utilize. These tools are often designed for single purposes to perform specific tasks.

- `calculate-reward-points.ts`: This tool is likely called by AI flows when a user action requires the computation of reward points. It probably takes in relevant action data (e.g., task completion, challenge participation) and outputs the calculated reward points.
